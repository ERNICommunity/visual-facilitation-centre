            <p><b>Use grey for shadows and light effect!</b> The impact of any visualisation, however simple, is
                improved by a couple of strokes in grey.
                To do this, you need to decide in advance what direction the light is coming in o the sun is shining
                (e.g. top left)
                and then, with just a little practice, you will know where the shadow will appear. Grey is a little
                miracle-worker
                visualisers!</p></div>

            <p><b>Write the word first!</b> Any form of decoration or emphasis should be the second stage.
                This applies to colours (e.g. 3D writing), lines (e.g. underlining) and, most importantly,
                for what are known as text borders. Text borders are any shape which can contain a text,
                such as a banner, an open book, an arrow or a sign. Write the word first (e.g. a header)
                and then draw the container around it. This ensures the border is always exactly the right size.</p>

            <p><b>Work on your writing!</b> Professional visualisation is most clearly expressed in your writing -
                it should not be a jumble of pictures, more a sensible combination of words and pictures.
                So take a little time to work on your writing. Learn moderation writing (hand resting on the paper,
                short up and downward strokes, letters close together (but not overlapping), sufficient space
                between individual words) or optimise your own style. A tip from us: do not let the group
                behind you put you off. Take your time - it's worth it!</p></div>

            <p><b>Use colours. But consistently!</b> Colours create order and make things clearer.
                They can be used for example, to highlight individual areas and separate them from other areas.
                For example, headings or subsidiary points can appear in one colour. This provides a central
                line which it is easy for the eye to follow. The structure and logic of your visualisation
                (e.g. a poster) becomes clear. Colours which are right next to one another in the colour circle
                (e.g. orange/yellow or purple/red) work well together and make a visualisation look more professional
                and calmer than a bright mish-mash of colours which do not tie together. Rule of thumb (so it does not
                get too colourful): black plus two colours. Grey can always be used for shadows.
